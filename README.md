This project is a Visual Studio 2017 Solution based on .NET Framework 4.6.1.

The instance generator is currently avaliable as a library.

Example files can be generated by running the System Tests, or just using the library in one's own code.

Json schema and examples of generated instances are also present in the System Tests resources (/SystemTestsProject/Resources).

Solutions and instances library is avaliable under: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w4p57qh3xvonzp6/AADfBbJ-s5K0Dj3NWc7u764Sa?dl=0 .



For some reason after cloning a clean repo I needed to build, clean and restart the VS before tests started working properly. It's probably a VS2017 issue.
