This project is a Visual Studio 2017 Solution.
It uses .NET Framework 4.6.1. There should be no issue with conversion to .NET Core 2.0/2.1 for use in systems other than Windows.

The instance generator is currently avaliable as a library. Console application is coming soon.

Files can be generated by running System Tests, or just using the library in one's own code.

Json schema and examples of generated instances are also present in the System Tests resources (/SystemTestsProject/Resources)
