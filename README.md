This project is a Visual Studio 2017 Solution based on .NET Framework 4.6.1.

The instance generator is currently avaliable as a library. I wil probably also create Console Application for that functionality later.

Example files can be generated by running the System Tests, or just using the library in one's own code.

Json schema and examples of generated instances are also present in the System Tests resources (/SystemTestsProject/Resources).

Solutions and instances library is avaliable under: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w4p57qh3xvonzp6/AADfBbJ-s5K0Dj3NWc7u764Sa?dl=0 .



For some reason after cloning clean repo I needed to clean and build the project twice and restart the VS before it started working properly. Probably VS2017 issue.
